-- Filter --
This classes getNextTuple function filters out rows that does not mean a certain condition on a particular attribute.
To do this we iterate over each tuple using the provided iterators getNextTuple function.  We then search through
the tuple until we find the attribute that matches the attribute the condition is for.  Then we extract this value
and compare it against the condition.  If the condition succeeds with this value, we return this tuple back.

-- Project --
This classes getNextTuple function projects out the attributes provided by the constructor. To do this, we iterate over
each tuple using the provided iterators getNextTUple function.  First we generate a nullIndicator based on the amount
of attribtues we want to project.  Then as we iterate over each attribute, we need to update this null indicator to
reflect if any of these attribtues are null.  And, as we are doing this, we need to also write this attribute value
to the correct position in the buffer.  Once this has been done, we return the buffer back.


-- Block Nested Loop Join --
This classes getNextTUple function will equijoin two tables on a given attribute.  In this function we are provided
a number of records in which we can store in memory.  So first, we will load a hashmap with the number of records provided
from the left join table.  Then we will iterate over the whole right table check the hashmap if the key from the left table
matches the key on the right table (key being the attribute we are joining on).  If they both match we then return that tuple.
To save state, we populate the whole hashmap first with the number of records, then set a boolean stating it does not need
to be populated again.  This boolean will not get changed until we have completely iterated over the whole right table.  
Otherwise, this would be incredibly wasteful.  From here, both iterates getNextTUples functions will save state of where
they are currently in the table so we don't have to worry about finding our way back to the current position.

-- Index Nested Loop Join --
This classes getNextTuple function works very similar to BNL except it does not use a hashmap to assist with speed.  This 
function will simply just iterate over the left table and then set the iterator for the right table with the attribute's value 
that is being joined on.  If this returns back any records, then simply return that record. Otherwise, loop over the left 
tables next tuple.  Left tables getNextTuple function will simply save state to prevent having to retrace your steps.

-- Basic Aggregation --
This classes getNextTUple will simply return a real value with the value of the aggregation on any particular attribute.
To do this, we simply iterate over a table and based on which AggregationOperator, we will collect the attributes value
and compare/sum up that value.  ONce the aggregate value has been calculated, we return that back to the caller.
